# hello-world


who am I?
Joseph, 23, an auditor

why am I learning to code?
I've been quite interested in coding and programming. Since I just pass the busy season, I have much spare time to do whatever I like. I accidentally ran into the free code camp, and got addicted to it. It's fun!

how am I been learning to code so far?
It's totally different from what I do at work, but I really like it. I'm gonna start my first project soon. I'm looking forward to it!
